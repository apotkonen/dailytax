# Daily Tax
## Sliding year Daily Tax automation delivers basic income support and collect taxes
### Universal idea to use mathematical methods for smooth tax and marginal tax without any lockups

Document does deep dive to Finnish tax and support system legacy before conclusions. Work is strongly related to Finnish wellbeing society basics; social support and taxation. There has been problems to get smooth automated system setup done because there are too much on/off-rules, officials manual work and poor processes. This generate delays, cost and gaps for service. This work here try to create proposal how to smoothen and automate taxation and support system. At least some discussion is expected.

**Fastest way to get overview without delving into details too much is to look figures:**
- Sliding 365 days window daily tax
- Social support and tax
- Support including childhood housing and daycare
- Burden of proof
- Digitalized process example

Here is document: [dailytax.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apotkonen/dailytax/main/dailytax.pdf "Download document") and Finnish language intro [vrkvero.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apotkonen/dailytax/main/vrkvero.pdf "Download document") for decision makers, which initial version has been delivered for group of people working with the item area questions. 

While following the official system development it's interesting to see how deep in Finland society, and decision making groups mind, is need to leave the burden of proof over the shoulders of individual citizen in trouble. This doesn't make system more secure what it should be to relase peoples to do something more productive, than carry continuous, repeating burden of proof, and be a kick ball for the others. We really can't afford to put peoples to do unproductive work and pay others to follow that demanded unproductive work will be done. From where these ideas of fools arise, in a country having every year smaller group of working aged citizens? Pay little less if it makes possible to remove the unneeded burden of proof and overwhelming bad treatment of peoples in trouble. It also free paid follow up personnel do something more productive work.

**Have a nice day :-).**
