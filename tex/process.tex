\chapter{Process}
\label{process}\index{process}
This document is mostly created from need to digitalize existing digitized
processes; in practice meaning simplification and automation of processes into
new digital environment. Taking into account possible optimizations from user
experience perspective what can be done now using these digital technologies.

In practice we have to combine normal citizen income taxing and social support
allowances to serve stability and safety for people most economically effective
way as possible. It is worth to ponder how simple taxation, support and legal
system could be if more elaborate models are used. 

Really good thing here is that there has been government Enterprice
Architecture (EA) running for a while, and we have some public documentation
available to discuss from area.

It's really important that architecture, processesses and interfaces are
publicly defined. It makes possible to subcontract needed components from
several vendors or from consortions offering bigger subintegrations for needed
solution.


\section{Income sources}
\label{income_sources}\index{income sources}
Peoples have some personal income sources like; wage, pension, insurance,
interest, dividend, rental, sale and/or social support income. Normally from
these incomes have several details available; payer, withholding, paid, period
start, end, payment date and place. Depending on from local laws these are
taxed differently, and political processes are used to change these
classifications to differently taxed incomes. It's good to ponder should these
different income sources be combined together as one or should we keep those
separate and maybe check does these income classes, event streams still using
same daily taxation technology.

\section{Interfaces and integration}
\label{interfaces_and_integration}\index{interfaces and integration}
Daily taxation needs; income account into some bank, and met\-hod to transfer
details, from income along transaction or as separate data transaction. Here
local government save income details into register. Same register can hold
different income class event details, taxed differently due political reasons.
For yearly cycled taxation this register solution is enough when employer or
other income source does withhold tax before payment and then tax payment
clearing, small corrections, are done yearly afterward. For daily tax there
also has to have access to income bank account for taxman automatic taxation
process, because idea is to serve social support and continuity with this
automated daily process.

\section{Layering and geographic segmentation}
\label{tax_layering}\index{tax layering}
Practical taxation process is quite different than what presented on simplistic
theory chapter. This because there are different communities having taxation
rights; municipality, religion communities, regional healthcare, state and
union. Each of these have humanistic behaviors leading to solution where they
have to be directly responsible to taxpayers. Even this responsibility is good
it's already lead to segregation. From industrial areas around main roads or
with sea connection and having migration win to remote agriculture and forestry
periphery municipalities having migration loss. There are some improvements to
this development like Green New Deal induced wind power, solar power and other
similar investments bringing big property tax incomes for municipalities.
Municipalities not yet got to new wind power or other improving investments are
forced to take high income tax to maintain economy.  South coastal cities have
a lot of community incomes and cites along major logistic channels are also
performing well.  Few places are famous from high average income and low tax,
which itself attract peoples having high income to manage elevated property
prices on those places. Then there is small municipality having new wind power
installation and attractive environment for holiday settlements has performed
better than other agricultural forest areas. Technically it would be easiest to
take taxes with same tax function fitting from all and then divide money for
communities having taxation rights. Anyhow, this could lead to situation where
taxed money is overused and that way taxed money is kept on own municipality
area.  This leads to ineffective operation. New social security reform leads to
province level taxation because this responsibility need and legislation to
manage this situation even now province level taxes are taken along with
national tax. Practice means that we have to have input parameters; social
security support, income, age, municipality, community, national (pro\-vin\-ce,
state, union) and consumer price index ratio for tax fitting function
definition. Most likely there has to be several tax fittings for different
parameter combinations.

Figure \ref{fig:muntax} on page \pageref{fig:muntax}
shows municipality tax fitting, which margin is around 10\%.

\section{Taxing process}
\label{tax_process}\index{tax process}
Created taxing model is applied daily using past 365 days sliding tax clearing
window. Process is repeated each day. Current yearly taxing practice means that
you have responsibility to fill in; income, age, health insurance, unemployment
insurance, pension insurance, municipality tax, community tax, state (radio,
province, state, union) events in even this in normally near fully automated
process so that employer and tax officials feed this information in. In new
daily process this automaton is taken further. Income from certain period is
distributed over period days and taxed daily. This is done automatically even
information completeness responsibility is still on taxpayer's side. New normal
taxation figure \ref{fig:taxing} on page \pageref{fig:taxing} show that you
have possibility to feed in income, reduction and other tax related events in
from last 365 days period, automatic calculation updates situation daily.
Figure shows only work income event handling, but same system is used for all
taxation relevant events person encounters. Older and than 365 events are
cleared like if you have forgotten to do. Big lump sums developed beyond that
365 days limit, for example from longer period work could be divided to further
1095 days and withholding is done against existing known tax functions, then
fixed daily with latest up\-to\-date tax information day by day. If tax
function is changed for higher tax and consumer price index, inflation
corrected withholding is not enough to fill that gap, then is risk is that
without any other income than daily support there could be tax debt cumulating,
still citizen should get \char"2154~from net support even under tax dept
distraint, see figure \ref{fig:SocialSu} on page \pageref{fig:SocialSu}.

\section{Calculation complexity}
\label{calculation_complexity}\index{calculation complexity}

Because for taxation we already have working setup, it's easy to do coarse
comparison to existing setup and estimate roughly how many times more faster
computing is needed if changed from yearly tax to daily tax, which require at
least 365 times faster computing rate $R$, to perform.

Day tax computing process does taxation for every day and divides each income
event given sums to income period days, calculating correct sums for those
days. So at average every day is gone through twice and one day peak load is
normal workers income event day when average 30+1, or peak 31+1, times capasity
is needed.

If we take tax administration year 1990\allowbreak\cite{VeroItDeployment} as
reference, when taxes computer calculation get done about at one year with
calculation capasity existed. Then estimating computing power change with
inverse of Koomey's law\allowbreak\cite{KoomeysLaw}\allowbreak\cite{
 DennardScaling}\allowbreak\cite{PerformanceDevelTop500} equation
\ref{eq:Koomey} on page \pageref{eq:Koomey} to estimate when tax administration
has possibility to 32x365=11680 times higher computing rate comparing to 1990,
to manage payday computing need for daily tax.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Koomey}
	K(\Delta t) =
	2^{(\frac{\Delta t}{1.57_y})} =
	2^{((t_2-t_1)/1.57_y)} =
	\frac{R_{t_2}}{R_{t_1}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:InverseKoomey}
	K^{-1}\left(\frac{R_{t_2}}{R_{t_1}}\right) =
	1.57_y \log_2\left(\frac{R_{t_2}}{R_{t_1}}\right) =
	t_2 - t_1 =
	\Delta t
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:InverseKoomeyTime}
t_1 + 1.57_y \log_2\left(\frac{R_{t_2}}{R_{t_1}}\right) = t_2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:InverseKoomeyTime20052021}
 \begin{array}{lrcll}
	 1990 + 1.57_y \log_2(& 2&\times&365  &) = 2005 \\
	 1990 + 1.57_y \log_2(&32&\times&365  &) = 2011 \\
	 1990 + 1.57_y \log_2(& 4&\times&365^2&) = 2020 \\
	 1990 + 1.57_y \log_2(& 6&\times&365^2&) = 2021
 \end{array}
\end{equation}

And then estimating worst case scanarions from migration. Worst is when there
come lump sum divided to next three years and taxation correction for past tax
during same day. Estimating, correction may affect max three years back and
lump sum three years forward resulting to max 6x365=2190 times existing
calculation load at one day for this persons data. It in worst case every
person have same problem then 2190x365 more computing power is needed
comparing to year 1990 to do fixes during an day-24h. When checking time with
Inverse Koomeys law \ref{eq:InverseKoomey} on page \pageref{eq:InverseKoomey},
we notice that we have about now capasity to change daily taxation and tolerate
all hiccups about on time a day. Koomey's law has slowed down a bit, but get
worst scanario can be migitated by doing batch works so that all possible
fixations for old taxation are not done at once. And after migration time there
should be corrections only to last 365 days resulting worst case be then
4x365=1460 times existing yearly load for one person one day calculation.

On average is two times more calculation resources is needed in an day than
normal yearly tax needs on year. Normal case is to have 31 times peak loads,
and extreme rare case single user processing may take up to 1460 or 2190 times
what normally needed for one year taxes calculation.

Storage need could be estimated to be about 10 doubles -- 80 bytes per day for
storing sums. It is 175kB per user and one terabyte 1TB for 5.5M users, not
including userdata holding addresses etc. which add some gigabytes GB over
that.

\section{Legal complexity}
\label{legal_complexity}\index{legal complexity}

As we have seen this daily tax is doable from information technology
performance perspective. Totally other thing is to get this done from national
legal legacy perspective. Of course existing yearly tax fixed reporting
dates can be done by adjusting sliding window (fig:\ref{fig:taxing} 
p.\pageref{fig:taxing}) size and doing summary tasks for certain dates.

Still, most biggest blocker for the sliding window daily tax usage is our
legal legacy habbits which are like patchwork quilt and natural process to
move patches from end to another and perhaps replace some worn patches with
few new even smaller ones. Result is still same length patchwork, but now with
even more mixed and distressing experience than before.
