As I have been quite long time Finnish citizen I have been seeing later
development, what it does when preemptive support for peoples, families and
children's heath, education and social care has been reduced year by year.
Now lot of money goes to care serious results from this habit and grown
average age. Worst thing here is that caring problems and re-enabling
preemptive care with current system and existing maintenance ratio goes over
budget if nothing else is done. And many peoples own budget has already failed
partly because we as society has been allowed to sell out and therefore from
local monopoles for electric delivery and significantly determinative market
positions on rentable property, housing and apartments market. Besides these
there are IT and goods logistic costs having external cream pealers groups on
significant market position. These areas are used to squeez money out from our
society, it's partly increased peoples support need, and this has been led to
higher support during the years, support which is now teared down. Problem is
that peoples are now left between profitmakers demands and subventions closing
sosiety created realities. We could already say that shit has hit into fan.
% and smell lingers around badly.
Overloaded, less paid healthcare workers are already escaping from profession
area\cite{KEVA_tyovoimaennuste}, medical institutions see declining amount of
applicants to profession area courses\cite{YLE202209221026}.
Teachers comment seriously that if knew current situation on work market when
started studies did not choosed to become a teacher. Etc.

\vskip\baselineskip
How we came to this situation at 2023 ?
\vskip\baselineskip
When looking national law making which does basement for Finnish wellbeing
society we need to note one bad habit we have. To maintain wellbeing society
new laws are nearly always made as small tweaks to existing law by adding new
law section, new on/off-rule or rules. After years of this kind of operation
the result is awful for normal citizens. It is mess of "on/off, on/off, if
then else on/off,..." -rules. It's nightmare for people having scarce
resources and need for help. Especially people lacking good digital
information search, bookkeeping and management capabilities is in really deep
shit! Fin\-nish nation has help-begging system for pen, paper and physical
access -peoples, and for others\cite{StudentHousingAllowance}, it's resource
consuming and inhumane. You are really pushed down before you can get
anything, if even then\cite{KELA_BASIC_ASSISTANCE_HalfOrNone}. Finnish mental
health and suicide statistics tell the truth\cite{SurunauhaTilastot} from less
performed peoples status. It's quite raw statistics: about four times more
suicides per year\cite{CausesOfDeath} than what dies at same time to traffic
accidents\cite{RoadAccidentStatistics}. According to world happiness
report\cite{WHR2023} happiest country is Finland. Happiness do not touch all
citizens of Finland. Nation doesn't really support peoples when they need help.
To get help on time you have to be preemptive\cite{KELATargetTime} by
yourselves\cite{Yle202412141253} and have some resources left\cite{KELAProcessingTime}.
Most peoples who really need help don't be that level systematic, or have lost
they touch, for reason or other. After loosing life control there are too many
paid "No", "Wait", "Fill this", "Forward to", "It takes a while", "Later", ..., -naysayers, paid
officials\cite{KELApalvelee}\-\cite{KELA_BASIC_ASSISTANCE_HalfOrNone}\-\cite{VR23_SocialBenefitsComics},
or created automations, transfer the burden of proof\cite{BurdenOfProof}
to the customer\cite{StudentHousingAllowance},
and same time exploitation companies; private dept collection agency's do they
best to hook people\cite{MOT_VelkaantuneidenVastaisku} who had to have from
9.3\cite{KELA_StudyGrant} to 18.5\euro/d\cite{KELA_BASIC_ASSISTANCE} for
bigger problems and make profit while people is temporalily insolvent due
delays in process, where quick quotation companies try also abuse, sell they
money with 35\%\cite{ConsumerCreditAndMicroloanCompanies} average interest.
This easily leads to personal backrupt, juridiciary\cite{MOT_VelkaantuneidenVastaisku} 
and National Enforcement Authority\cite{NationalEnforcementAuthorityFinland}
even supports private collections agency to make profit\cite{PaymentDefaultStatistics},
and results are really obvious, brutal -- deeply not wellbeing peoples,
eating psychoactive drugs\cite{DepressionValidTreatment} as daily
bread\cite{YLE202112131842}\-\cite{YLE202305170931}\-\cite{YLE202311120715}\-\cite{STM_UglyNumbers20230703}.
%\cite{YLE201208241434}
When peoples finally get this "help" it's outdated, late\cite{PosCredReg},
not informed and not to original problem but more for consequences
\cite{YLE202112131842}\-\cite{SocialLend}\-\cite{MOT_VelkaantuneidenVastaisku}
to fail fix the original problem.

Finnish society also thinks employee development always from current employer
perspective. Which many times is wrong perspective, because need to
development under existing employer service usually comes from need to change
from current work to something other. And then it is "fifty-sixty" old versus
new employer what is needed. Usually it's 100\% of employee own need to develop
itself to be relevant, capable to continue further on working life at current
life and health situation\cite{TR_202306151300}. It might be same employer's
task, but as well it can be something else, other employer, third sector,
entrepreneur, research,... what ever, but so that peoples can maintain they
health and control to they own life. This is partly understood\cite{VN_202303241233},
but not fully\cite{AdultEducationAllowance}\-\cite{VN_2023/58}.

Current system has these on/off -flaws which make peoples to be out of working
life, working 0\% or full 110\% working life to be able to carry economic
burden we have. There are not many good possibilities between these two choices.
There should be whole variation of working life load levels here between these
0\% and 110\% really! And there isn't!

\vskip\baselineskip
What we can do for this existing not so great legacy?
\vskip\baselineskip
We can't really fully solve all these problems, but can give advice how to
empower peoples to care themselves more with less by reducing they mental,
financial and physical resources load\cite{KELA_BASIC_ASSISTANCE}, giving them
more control with less of operational cost. Solution is sliding 365 days
window daily tax with tax curves (fittings, functions) depended on age,
capable to deliver child benefit, study grant, basic income support,
home care allowance, basic sick leave allowance, rehabilitation allowance,
unemployed basic allowance, adult education benefit and housing allowance.
Those are merged seamlessly into system behind the scenes into curves without
any action needed, not setting any income traps for anyone. This setup
guarantees some income every day, because benefits or "negative tax" is paid
daily into account until period actual wage payment comes, which is taxed
taking in the account already paid "negative tax" during the period day. And
curve is designed so that every euro in income increase net income after tax.
There will be less effective income traps from other support forms than before
because of merging and directing correctly child's benefits to the child.
Parent, caretaker only manages these for the child.

Current government want to get more with less. Automatically delivered basic
support suits well to social security reform\cite{STM_202306021239} project
start time and government saving targets\cite{VN_2023/58}. Automated delivery
trustfulness, timely accuracy, without locking, is more and more meaningful,
when paid sums purchasing power is going to decline, be smaller than before.
Therefore basic monetary support delivery has to be automated whitout any
human factors in it, to get it delivered correctly on time without delays!

Actual document goes guite straightly to proposal details, checks existing
renoval and other documentation material then does corrections to proposal,
generalizes and extends it towards more straight automated solution, then
finally is existing implementation documentation looked and commented a bit.

Booklet meaning is to raise debate from existing digitized tax, etc. process
digitalization ;-). Hopefully you get some ideas from here for life, or for
your further professional life discussons!\hfill\break
