\chapter{Implementation}
\label{implementation}\index{implementation}

Implementation depends on from solution purpose. For demonstration simple
solution without any availability and security requirements is enough as long
basic operations can be done. National solution level there are a lot of
development needs from model itself and from possible other integrations not
seen here. Implementation is most likely embedded into existing systems besides
operating ones. So it would be possible to run new process besides old ones
with correct current data. Some code is already available as Open Source
Software (OSS)\allowbreak\cite{FSFE_PublicCode}\allowbreak\cite{DayTax}...

Hopefully this more automatic, less bureaucratic system implementation is
started this time \cite{BasicIncomeInit}\allowbreak\cite{
 LiberaPerustili}\allowbreak\cite{A2PalkkaerotIlta}\allowbreak\cite{
 UniversalCredit}\allowbreak\cite{UniversalBasicIncome}. Global solution needs
serious planning from process and possible other tax areas and toll processes
maybe wanted to bring together into new "global rolling tax day" -perspective
created solution family, capable to handle value added tax, even scaled to
astronomical level \cite{LTEonMoon}. Maybe too premature idea here, but still
good keep in mind while planning different stages implementation so that don't
set up any showstoppers for further development on celestial scale, including
at least near orbit's, Moon and Mars.

\section{Initial situation}
\label{db_initial_situation}\index{database, initial situation}
This is simplified model from existing income tax, where there are three
register keepers, municipalities and state government having taxing rights.
Province and union taxes are embedded into state tax. Taxation happens
semi-automatically at once of year. System is rigid, inflexible and usually
cause uncertainty to peoples economic situation, specially at autumn near
year-end. Every corrective adjustment needs extra activity, which is
exhaustive if you are already in tight unexpected financial position due
reason or other. Figure \ref{fig:DbInitial} on page \pageref{fig:DbInitial}.
Tax administration has some idea from needed change \cite{
 SemiAutomaticWitholdingRate}, but as long as it is based to fixed tax period
year, it still has tax period edge effect we should avoid. Needed laws changes
take long and therefore we has to have much more proactive technososioeconomic
optimized vision from future.

\section{Theory part speculations}
\label{db_theory_speculations}\index{database, theory testing}
There are old income tax tables fed into system, province tax is separated
from state tax, and created possibility to separate union taxes. Community
tax, besides municipal taxes, as they are under FinLex. This configuration
makes possible to play, compare old and new solutions. Still lacking
statistics or proper distribution form, which can be used to determine balance
point for given social support. Anyhow, usable to play with when initialized,
fed with the law given values. Figure \ref{fig:DbSpeculation} on page
\pageref{fig:DbSpeculation}.

\section{Demonstration}
\label{implementation_demo}\index{implementation demo}
Target state is presented on figure \ref{fig:DbDemoTarget} at page
\pageref{fig:DbDemoTarget}. It will be able to handle income tax and other
taxes too. Resolution time is below two days globally. Mostly clearing can be
done during 24 hours at latest during next 48 hours for global transactions.

TBD (To Be Done) maybe.

\section{National version}
\label{implementation_national}\index{implementation national}
Someone has to do this! There is automatic withholding percentage correction
proposal for the yearly tax, which is better than nothing, but not enough.
Tax legislation and tax system has to be changed, improved.

\section{Global version}
\label{implementation_global}\index{implementation global}
Maybe some day if financed?

\section{Beyond taxation}
\label{beyond_taxation}\index{beyond taxation}
This document has been concentrated to taxation and basic social support which
can be integrated, automated with taxation. Besides this proposed highly
automated basic social support with daily tax, there are still lot need for
discretionary support mostly due to ilness, disability etc. special reasons.
In order to understand the problem field, we have to look a little at the
model of the current setup and fastly changing situation we live in.

\subsection{Existing architecture}
\label{existing_architecture}\index{existing architecture}

In Finland the Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV) is kind of
responsible from population data details and digitalization services
generally, and they domain is "dvv.fi". Properties are registered under
National Land Survey (NLS) services. Income register and taxation details are
on tax domain "vero.fi". Social welfare and healthcare sector domain is
"kanta.fi" holding patient data repository, diagnosis, prescriptions etc. Then
there is the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (KE\-LA), "kela.fi"
domain paying in this document with the taxation automation proposed support
and many other discretionary supports. When looking KE\-LA from architecture
documents \cite{SYPLJULK}, you clearly see that it's describing current
situation. From Figure 3.1 Social and health information managment central
players \cite{SYPLJULK_Kuva_3.1} you can notice that KE\-LA's explicit role as
social and health insurance company from customer financing perspective is
left out, forgotten. Kela's roles are only mentioned on describing text.

\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \epsfig{figure=figures/players.eps,width=\textwidth}
  \caption{Players}
  \label{fig:players} \index{players}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

This significantly affects to digitalized customer process planning, because
so central player is only iplicitly visible, when thinking KE\-LA's role as
sosial and health financial services provider. Every person doing digitalized
process planning has to notice this when dealing with KE\-LA's roles and one
is left out, during new digitalized service processes creation.

\subsection{Initial situation}
\label{initial_situation}\index{initial situation}

Initial situation, today's baseline is where processes are mostly just
digitized version from old pen, paper and physicall access versions from
history behind thirty years. There are lot of processes which are not
digitalized at all, meaning in practice overall technososioeconomical
optimization, fully rewised, rewritten, simplified processes.

\subsection{Practical examples}
\label{practical_examples}\index{practical examples}

\subsubsection{Elderly peoples example}
When elderly people is under counties wellbeing services and assessment of the
need is done by for this purpose named nurce or doctor. If home service need
is detected, this detection has to be saved to medical records base "KANTA" and
to be marked as possible cost/support affecting decision. Decision which could
directly be used to same organization "Kela", the Social Insurance Institution
of Finland managed costs reimburcements reasoning, at least with patien
customer, this elder people, promise to allow sensitive information cross
organization use like financing part from wellbeing services, pointed service
provider services used. Reality is from last millenium for pen, paper and
physical access citizens. They ask relatives, perhaps from different side of
country to help with these things. Relatives first need computer, network
connection, working printer to print papers, and then someone possible travels
severel hundred kilometers carry laptop with, purchase printer from market and
print those papers, fill those with elder people and post to Kela, which
basically could then look decision details from Kanta, but no, they reply with
mail that elder people has to deliver doctors statement during next three
weeks or request is cancelled. This paper then comes to elder people home, and
when relatives come again in place during one month this three weeks is just
passed and request is cancelled. In practice elder people has no access to
medical records and not own paper copy either because demand to arrange service
is not given as paper for elder people even requested to arrange support. So in
practice relatives has to request time for doctor again and arrange again new
trip over several hundred kilomenters to carry elder people to doctor to dig
out decision from Kanta or do new one now with certificate on paper for Kela.
See figure \ref{fig:burdofpr} on page \pageref{fig:burdofpr}. Yep, Kela does
very effectively these decicions to neglect reasoned support, but is anyone
checked process from elderly persons user experience perspective -- so from
Pen, Paper, Physical-access Peoples Perspective? This is severe wasting of
overall resources available\allowbreak\cite{ElakelElakel}\allowbreak\cite{
 ElakelaisetEivatTieda}. Kela has to have capability to check medical records
from Kanta with the permisson of elder people given at initial request without
asking older people and in practice hes relatives to arrange second evaluation
for need what counties wellbeing services are already done! This is digized
manual process, causing more load and delay than original process before
computers utilized at all. Because all is done twice, first digitally and then
manually, even decisions are done twice, first time to initiate service, and
then again to get reasoned reimburcement. It doesn't help anything to use
artificial intelligence\allowbreak\cite{PerukirjaTukiehdotuksetTekoaly} to
replace human application decicion making, because the whole process is
crippled, and currect artificial intelligence doesn't yet have rights nor
intelligence to replace whole process yet.Therefore this process has to be
digitalized so that done decisions are on Kanta and Kela's human (or
artificial) intelligence is able to look decisions reasoning directly from
there, at least with information owner given permission given in related
suomi.fi-application from! Now form doesn't even include question from
permission to look Kanta to see well being area records for
decision\allowbreak\cite{LifeEventDetailDrivenProcessQuides}.

 \end{center}
\end{figure}

See "Digitalized"-process figure \ref{fig:digitalized} on page
\pageref{fig:digitalized}, how much less it uses resources when comparing to
original "Burden of Proof"-process figure \ref{fig:burdofpr} on page
\pageref{fig:burdofpr}, even lot of needed elderly people relatives helping
effort is not drawn visible to process figure \ref{fig:burdofpr} \cite{
 VMAuroraAiNakokulmiaIhmiskeskeisyyteen}. Result is that peoples give up and do
not get available financial support \cite{ElakelElakel}\allowbreak\cite{
 ElakelaisetEivatTieda}\allowbreak\cite{
 StudentHousingAllowance}\allowbreak\cite{
 Many_Stepwise_Rules_Leads_To_Mess}... system just increase
bureaugratic overhead. System hast to be fixed\allowbreak\cite{
 LEX_2025_1159}\allowbreak\cite{EHDS} or removed\allowbreak\cite{STM061_2025}!

  \label{fig:digitalized} \index{process digitalized}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Passed people genealogy example}
To sort out passed people things you has to have DVV report from family
relationships, and you have to request DVV's fully digitally generated report
from DVV by yourself during mourning, and lot of other changes due perhaps the
30\euro~price. Even governemnt will tax passed people assets transfer further
anyway, and they mostly know due police and/or doctors created passing out
infos and automatic generation should start immediately on DVV. Possible other
registers, from curch books, could be initiated as well in most cases. Costs
should be taken from inheritance tax and do this step automatically, transfer
money later though budget what inheritance tax feeds. I hope that this
improvement\allowbreak\cite{SukuselvitysPerukirja} will proceed.

\subsubsection{Examples summary and some other findings}
\label{examples_summary_and_findings}
\index{examples summary and findings}
I am quite sure that if we check more these "services" we find more and more
direct digitization of old process without real digitalization. Every service I
lately have personally touched has had these problems with the procesesses.
This is national shame, at least should be \cite{
 Many_Stepwise_Rules_Leads_To_Mess}\allowbreak\cite{
 StudentHousingAllowance}\allowbreak\cite{ElakelaisetEivatTieda}... And it has
to be fixed, either by digitalizing processes from customer perspective or by
merging and removing unnecessary rules, payments.

\paragraph{Social Insurance Institution (SII) card}
\label{SII_card}\index{SII card}
Releated to social security insurance we get repeative request for the persons
Social Insurnce Institution (SII) card ID "SOTU", even if you are used strong
identification delivering personal identity code "HETU" to log into system or
shown identity card for personnell using fully to state services integrated
systems. It's frustrating finding from how base level issues are still not
solved on our "digitalized" service paths.

It tells that there is no interface nor integration or legal support to check;
does person personal identy number "HETU" have related social security
insurance identity "SOTU" at social insurance institution (SII). SII "KELA" is
the same organization delivering native insurences and the base "KANTA" against
most most systems are integrated to deliver information to e-perscriptions or
epicrisis. Why don't deliver social insurance existense status as well?

There is still some improvements needed between DVV and KELA application
interfaces and integrations. For native Finnish citizen social security
insurance identity number "SOTU" is same than native personal identity number
"HETU". Seem to be needless to ask does those services work with an Electronic
Unique Identification Number "SATU", which would be better, more secure for
the electric transactions, because it can be replaced on case of identity teft.

\paragraph{Standardized clinical operation description, metadata}
\label{clinical_data}\index{clinical data}

We have good start around KANTA-base, some existing working processes, some
verbal process descriptions in practice. What is lacking is target process
descriptions and descriptions from the next steps, step by step through the
service paths, use case by use case\allowbreak\cite{
 LifeEventDetailDrivenProcessQuides}. Localized common clinical
data\allowbreak\cite{HealthEventsActionsMetaData}; action, operation event
common standardized descriptions are totally missing, from citizen perspective,
it seems that there isn't much reasonable cooperation happening in the Finnish
scene related to this. At least Finnish and Swedish language translations from
european or global dataset are not visible publicitly as should be, if we want
to have common standardized dataset used to define patient service paths,
dividing actions and operations to most relevant place of welfare services
area. This also improve possibility to use any other EU country services, or
service from abroad, if they are cheaper, than locally available ones. Common
metadata is allowing public and commercial service providers available
resources and timeslots, most technososioeconomic way optimized allocation and
use.

\paragraph{Common course description data through all levels}
\label{course_data}\index{course data}

Similarly we are lacking common structured course content, metadata and courses
structural data for our education system\allowbreak\cite{
 CoursesAndRequirements} in country which population could fit to single city
and which new generations are from year to year smaller than the previous ones.

\paragraph{Summary from education cooperation gaps}
\label{education_cooperation_gaps}\index{education cooperation gaps}

Without the cooperation and standardization on healtcare and education leads
to situation where same, or at least overlapping work, is done on several paid
projects. As nation do we have enough wealth to pay from repeative, partly not
needed, overlapping, frankly said; semi\-productive tasks slowing the
development down? Private parties do not complain because repeatition keeps
they order book full. From year to year smaller generations and broader study
variations need clearly visible trend which will force units to close if
reasonable cooperation and specialization is not done early enough.

In future it's more important that peoples can choose, cherry pick, part of
courses to make things they are keen to develop. Peoples learning capasity
is not grown so much that they can blindly learn everything, therefore
creation of new success stories need wide education material and courses
supply with possibility to cherry pick courses for they own ideas, dreams
to come true, for real success stories at megatrends, eco-trends, space
exploration and utilization.

We need reasoable size learning of old and then something new need to
be combined. Whole package should be one person imaginable, understable.

We need cooperation and standardization on learning courses metadata and
content to manage more with less and be productive doing new thigs with
the saving benefits we got from cooperation.

\subsection{
 Uneven load and reimbursement on public and private tracks of our healt care}
\label{unbalance_on_two_tracks}\index{unbalance on two tracks}
There has been at least four decades continued chaining and centralization on
private healthcare services side. It has brought good things, but same time
it's brought also bad things because all employer financed employee helthcare
services are well financed and mainly care basically health peoples. Peoples
having serious health issues usually get sickness pension and drop over the
health area health services. So health areas have more problematic customers
who are scattered around large regional areas. Some communs have very high
average age on areas in the middle of nowhere. Column from Heikki Hiilamo
\cite{HiilamonKolumni202411250645} points clearly this during the years
collected unbalance.

Solution is easy; All health services, including employer paid, are set to
same line. Law is changed so that employer payment is taken as part of company
taxing and health areas having university hospitals are then arranging the
services, by themself, with the other health areas, and by purchasing from
existing competitive pricing capable service providers. Heikki Hiilamo
pointed out bit more polaid taxing change\allowbreak\cite{
 YleAtalk202412122106} where employer health services are only changed to be
taxed benefits, which makes public and private services more comparable related
to financing and customers average heath situation on both user groups.

But even in this case there is no need for 25 separate health service areas,
here including Finnish Student Health Services (FSHS/YTHS) and Åland Islands as
additional healt areas besides the existing 23, which is much more than we have
university hospitals (Helsinki, Tampere, Turku, Kuopio, Oulu) already having
management structures, understanding from education resources and possibilities
for new medical professionals training. Therefore national wide resourcing
decisions are left for the university hospitals and Ministry of Social Affairs
and Health. This should include evaluation for the overall need for these 25
health service areas. All 25 areas in this country which population equals to
one big city!

It should be enough to do service optimization so that for service total cost
includes customer resources use. In practice meaning that each hour customer
has to use to get service is priced at least with the minimum wage or actual
wage if being in work, and including all travel time, travel costs from door
to door and back. With this kind of finacial evaluation we maintain reasonable
near services, centralize regional and national service socially and
economically viable manner. By giving in middle of nowhere living person used
time value by counting it as worktime we take human value in account
\cite{Yle202411251731}.

In practice meaning that basic healtcare services are brought near by even
there is only few customers, because calculation points it feasible when
everyone's resource consumption is taken into account. Return of "own medical
doctor model" is already proposed\allowbreak\cite{
 Yle202410222121}\allowbreak\cite{YleAstudio202410292107} and
supported\allowbreak\cite{Yle202411191722} to as solution for basic problems
with the existing system. Own doctor model reduces the effects of poor
integrations and processes in system, because same professional person use own
memory and own local system which is there still between the visits, no matter
does the data been delivered to kanta-base or not. Still data must be delivered
to kanta-base for case of move or other need to get service at somewhere else
where also access to persons stored health data, epicrisis is needed.

\subsection{Target situation}
\label{target_situation}\index{target situation}

All processes are gone through overall technososioeconomical optimization,
fully rewised, rewritten, simplified processes, look\-ed from both producer
and customer perspectives when cheking overall technosocioeconomical
optimization from national, european union, and in some cases from global
perspective.

Thinking through the service paths, individuals organizations and processes
along citizens service path. Special interest on standardization, removal
of overlapping efforts and actual information flow, how it usually goes now;
\hfill\break\begin{center}
digital(text)~-~paper(text)~-~digized(pixels)~-~digital(text)
\cite{VM006_00_2024},\end{center}
and how we can support citizen to do most with less, meaning that data goes
from service provider to Kanta, or if it goes through citizens message services
then receiving end should get it as text-data not as picture-pixels someone
has to digitize by hand as work time process. If not any better methods found
for filled forms then pure ASCII/ISO 8859-1 text-form would be enough good for
the process because it can be filled and forwarded by citizen as well as
healtcare worker etc., and it can be signed and forwarded electronically.
Anyhow Kanta-base should be preferred and citizen could get message or paper
copy to remember it.

\subsection{Expectations}
\label{expectations}\index{expectations}

We have seen govenment enterprice architecture exercise, human centric
artificial intelligence program and Finninsh municipalities association's good
work around government and municipalities enterprice arhitecture. It's good
to see human centric open govenmental digital architetecture activities.
Public money -- public code\allowbreak\cite{FSFE_PublicCode}, public service --
public data\allowbreak\cite{OpenPublicData}, public society -- public
processes\allowbreak\cite{VM_GBEA}\allowbreak\cite{Kukkonen2025}, public and by
nature modular architecture are good values to maintain cooperation and common
wealth, because everybody's contribution can multiply common output and this
way bring civil society efforts to common use, same time reducing overall cost
and time what takes to get results and control position for democratically
selected government from society's own digital service environment.

The fear is that human centric enterprice arhitecture development is done in
project mode leaving results unmaintained. Enterprice arhitecture management
and development is CRITICAL SERVICE, not a project\allowbreak\cite{VM_GBEA}.
Architecture all time evolving at least now when we live era of fast
digitalization. We need current state, target state, gap and next development
step visibility online to be up to date, and discussion from next steps ongoing
for sub areas needing development work. Modular architecture selection supports
work division, utilization of the others results, as well making possible
procurement using small vendors or consortium model where several small
providers bring they efforts to common pool.

It's really hard task to get needed human centric over the organizational
limits happening process digitalization thinking going into practice in our
silo-organizations sitting peoples heads. It requires from managment that they
are capable to set up virtual teams over organizational limits on need bases.
This has to be understood and approved on upper management levels, and we
really need to get it going into execution on our practical day to day work.
For work we really need public version from government enterprice
architecture\allowbreak\cite{Kukkonen2025} which shows at least processes over
the whole governmental field. Created new digitalized processes has to be
tecnososioeconomical optimized versions before implementation procurement.

Worst case is that we have not done our homework and some profitmaker makes
promise to our politicians who do not understand, and during investement
implementation vendor locking is created, valuable to whole invested money
and more, nearly as good as natural monopoly, and then this is monetized to
profitmakers benefit and to our society's loss in form of oversized operation
and further development investment expenses. And it's not first time our
publically superviced natural monopoles are sold out for money making, so
need to be aware.
