\label{theory}\index{theory}
Existing yearly tax is function of person age $a$ on taxation date and income
$i$. To be encouraging and fair marginal tax should be continuous, smooth
because it tell how much tax is taken if you earn anything more what you have
already earned and any jumps on marginal tax cause motivation traps. It's good
to notify that smoothness requirement is for predictable changes like income
and age chan\-ge. Sudden change, like taxation function change during season
doesn't have similar smoothness requirement, because it's sudden and peoples
can't do protective tax planning against it. Therefore this kind of sudden
change do not set any motivation barriers at least at first time. Of course
some municipality may have habit to play with possibility to change taxation,
and does it frequently, it may cause some activities on peoples. Maximum tax
percentage should also be limited due same reason. Besides tax you may have
acceptable reductions to income, and those are taken away from income before
taxation. Social supporting income when person own income is too low for living
is added to automated taxation process to avoid bureaucracy.
\section{Tax function requirements}
\label{tax_function_requirements}\index{tax function requirements}
Here we have mathematical from definitions and requirements for tax function
$t()$. Tax function parameters income $i$ and age $a$. Tax function limits
maximum tax $m$ and low income tax limit $l$. Requirements from continuity and
smooth behavior for fax function, it's derivative and for marginal tax.

\section{Social perspective}
\label{social_perspective}\index{social perspective}
Currently taxation is done yearly, and having filling and closing dates.
Existing social support, monthly pays on everything and yearly taxation is
requiring some prediction and planning capabilities from taxable person.
Current digital economy part-time, zero agreement, jobs and other insecurities
is too much for many peoples and they lose control from they life. There comes
unsecured times without income and this stress peoples very much. Big part if
person capacity goes to unproductive activities to save euro cents and beg
money from society. Which activity alone increase cost and load even more for
already troubled people. Therefore, taxation period should be shortened from
year to one day. Social security support has to be integrated into taxation
system so that peoples can feel some security, stay concentrated, productive,
develop itself and make better life. It doesn't mean that support should be
big. It means that support has to be daily and guaranteed so that you have
possibility to maintain yourselves. Someone may ask that is there any limit for
this daily allowance "$d$" money distribution? Answer is that yes there is
limit which limits possibility to have more support and still have smooth
taxing system. Upper limit for taxable support is nominal gross domestic
product per capita "$n$" times marginal tax "$m$", and then tax is flat
constant marginal tax for all, which is kind of mathematical limit,
politically, psychologically for human acceptable limit is much less. These
limits are highly country dependent, and therefore only some wide ranges given.
Mathematically those are more like hints to check your calculations if going
much under or over.
\index{support fit requirements}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:const_n}
n \in (0,1000) \in \mathbb{R}^+
~;~ n \simeq 130
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:const_d}
d \in [0,600] \in \mathbb{R}^+
~;~ d \simeq 5, 10, 20 \leq n
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:const_s}
s: [0,44000]\in\mathbb{N} \rightarrow [0,600] \in \mathbb{R}^+
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sup_s}
s(a)\leq d \leq mn
\end{equation}
When we look existing law sections, those on off rules
(LEX\allowbreak\cite{LEX_2012_916en}), and combine social support $s(a)$ so
that some small daily income can be guaranteed without any bureaucracy. For
that we draw figure \ref{fig:Support} on page \pageref{fig:Support} from
existing lowest acceptable social support level (Social Security Committee
\cite{VN_2023_26} p.23 figure 3 and p.38 figure 5) and do several adjustments
to get support work smoothly automated way without bureaucracy. Because child
parents get basic allowance automatically we change child home care allowance
to be child's own benefit combining child benefit and half of old home care
benefit to be new child own home care benefit and set it on level of adult's
basic allowance\allowbreak\cite{VN_2025_22}. If counting together child's home
care allowance and parents basic income support it's about on old parents home
care support level, but automatically. Doing siblings in row will grow child
home care allowance to level of old child home care allowance. Child home care
allowance is full for one year and then come to pure child benefit level at age
three years. Child start to miss other children company between one and two and
half years age, depending from siblings, and should be on day care at latest
from three years old to grow social and get professional preschool training.
From school age seven years child care is increased gradually to support
child's enthusiasm recreation interests positive way by offering money for
developing and caring hobby, same time keeping children away from headless
streetdander which easily lead aimless child under outsiders' manipulation,
abuse and exploitation - dreadful plunge spiral - which costs for child and
nation are massive and should be avoided. This growing child care benefit is
also replacing old multi child family increased child benefit automatically
(ITLA \cite{ITLA_2023_LL}). When study obligation ends to maturity age than we
should support growth and child moving to education site dormitory. Therefore
study grant plus student housing benefit should be on level of basic income
support, basic sick leave allowance, rehabilitation allowance and unemployed
basic allowance which all are then combined together to form basic allowance
for rest of your life. It's paid for all, day by day pieces and taxed away
when your incomes grow on professional life. But it's there if you get sack or
get old enough. Separate pay level insurances and pensions you have bought are
then paid over that by insurance companies and those payments are taxable
income as normal income.

Now when we have combined different old benefits from birth to death to one
figure \ref{fig:Support} on page \pageref{fig:Support} we also add about old
level allowance for daily payment $d$ and do fitting function equation 
\ref{eq:sup_gross} $s_d(a,d,r)$ so that consumer price index change ratio $r$
can be taken into account automatically. This is important because support
level is low for peoples in need and rapid changes in prices has to be taken in
account automatically. National economy balance is then managed by managing tax
fitting on fly. Equation \ref{eq:sup_gross6} match to figure \ref{fig:Support}
on page \pageref{fig:Support} situation.

\section{Tax function fitting}
\label{tax_function_fitting}\index{tax funtion fitting}
To get well adjustable taxation system we could and should use mathematical
methods like series which are usually working well from zero to one range for
fitted functions. Therefore, it would be good to use general tax fitting
function $f$ which is then scaled to range from zero to tax margin and income
parameter is also scaled to match current currency value. This scaling makes
easier adjust taxation to inflation changes using consumer price index and
calculation period change from year to date. It would be good to add automatic
consumer price index check into calculation system. So for fit function we have
requirements on equations from \ref{eq:def_f} to \ref{eq:df_smooth}.
\index{fit function requirements}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:def_f}
 f:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0,1]\in\mathbb{R}^+
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:tax}
%f(a,i)\leq 1 ~;~ a \in \mathbb{N}, i \in \mathbb{R}^+
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:tax_min}
% \lim_{i \to 0} f(a,i)\simeq 0 \leq0.1
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f_min}
 \lim_{i \to 0} f(a,i) = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f_max}
 \lim_{i \to \infty} f(a,i) = 1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:df_min}
 \lim_{i \to \infty} f'(a,i)=0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:f_smooth}
 |i-i_0|<\delta \implies |f(a,i)-f(a,i_0)|<\epsilon
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:df_smooth}
 |i-i_0|<\delta \implies |f'(a,i)-f'(a,i_0)|<\epsilon
\end{equation}
Because national tax office is anyway doing detailed tuning, like age
dependency, we could just take something very simple function equation
\ref{eq:fit_simp} to play with it as demonstration from fit function use
equation \ref{eq:fit_func} for tax. Fit function derivative equation
\ref{eq:dfit_func} is needed for fit function marginal tax equation
\ref{eq:tax_mrg}, \ref{eq:mfit_func}.
\index{fit function}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fit_simp}
 f(i) = b^{-\frac{cr}i} ~;~ b,c,i,r \in \mathbb{R}^+
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fit_deri}
 f'(i) = \frac{df}{di}~b^{-\frac{cr}i} = b^{-\frac{cr}i} \frac{cr}{i^2}\ln(b) 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fit_func}
 f(a,i,m,c,r) = m b^{-\frac{cr}i} ~;~ b > 1.0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dfit_func}
 f'(a,i,m,c,r) = \left(\frac{cr}{i^2}\ln(b)\right) m b^{-\frac{cr}i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mfit_func}
 m(a,i,m,c,r) = \left(\frac{cr}i\ln(b)+1\right) m b^{-\frac{cr}i}
\end{equation}
Next we select coefficients; marginal tax $m$, income cash $c$ on period you
have $m/b$ \% tax, consumer price index ratio $r$ for period, equations
\ref{eq:fyearly_tax}-\ref{eq:fdaily_tax} and for fitted function marginal tax
equation \ref{eq:mfit_func}. Then figure \ref{fig:DailyTax} on page
\pageref{fig:DailyTax} is drawn to show results. As you can see marginal tax is
quite smooth function and there are no motivation traps where additional earned
money is practically taxed away. If we now add daily social support to this and
tax it, then it basically adds net amount after marginal tax for everyone. To
keep budged in balance on national level tax curve has to be buckled little up
or marginal tax lifted a bit. Because marginal tax is about 60\% already most
obvious solution is to touch base number here in our demonstration fitting and
figure \ref{fig:BaseTax} on page \pageref{fig:BaseTax} show how fitting behaves
when changing base coefficient.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tax_max}
t_m \in [0.0,1.0] \in \mathbb{R}^+ ~;~ t_m = m \simeq 0.6
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fyearly_tax}
t_y(a,i_y)=f(a,b=e,i=i_y,m=0.6,c=30000,r=1)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fdaily_tax}
t_d(a,i_d)=f(a,b=e,i=i_d,m=0.6,c=\frac{30000}{365},r=1)
\end{equation}

 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Next we use support daily gross value $s_d$ and define equations
\ref{eq:support_net_cash} - \ref{eq:supported_tax_cash}; support daily net
value after tax $S_d$, tax including support as negative tax value $T_s$, net
income, including social support $I_s$, and tax counting daily support as
taxable $T_d$. If using original tax in current, cash $T$ equation
\ref{eq:tax_cash_daily} without taking in account support effect to reduce
gathered tax amount and compensate it in tax equation then accumulated tax sum
is smaller and cause problems. Therefore, tax fitting has to be adjusted to
take support in account when daily support is applied.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:support_net_cash} \index{support daily}
S_d(a,i_d) = s_d(a) + t_d(a,i_d)i_d - t_d(a,s_d(a)+i_d)(s_d(a)+i_d)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:supported_tax_cash} \index{tax negative}
T_s(a,i_d)=t_d(a,s_d(a)+i_d)(s_d(a)+i_d)-s_d(a)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:supported_cash_net} \index{income supported}
I_s(a,i_d)=(1-t_d(a,s_d(a)+i_d))(s_d(a)+i_d)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:supported_tax_cash_daily} \index{tax daily}
T_d(a,i_d)=t_d(a,s_d(a)+i_d)(s_d(a)+i_d)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tax_cash_daily}
T(a,i_d)=t_d(a,i_d)i_d
\end{equation}

\section{Available statistics}
\label{income tax statistics}\index{income tax statistics}
In Finland most income and tax related things are public, at least in theory,
if information acquirement cost in time, money and other resources is limitless
you can get yearly income numbers form past years. In practice you have some
statistics available for free, and about top 1000 individuals are listed on
yellow press tabloids, web pages\allowbreak\cite{IncomeTaxSmoothness}.
Electrically income data, even in obfuscated form, nor income distribution
function details, are not available, at least I didn't found those. Available
statistics are from "consumption units", including some interpretation from
childs, young peoples as consumption units, not
individuals\allowbreak\cite{ConsumptionUnitD}. Statistic already include income
transfers, meaning that needed data from individuals is not availalable. Income
statistics appendix on page \pageref{statistics} tell more from data
acquisition.

Without correct data from individuals we only illustriate from "consumption
units" aquired data, figure \ref{fig:ConsumptionUnit} on page
\pageref{fig:ConsumptionUnit} as kind of data needed from individuals to
estimate, define possible cost neutral chan\-ges for taxation to create income
transfers automation -- and reduce costly unnecessary bureaucracy. Either
original obfuscated data or accurate propability density function fitting for
data is needed.

\begin{figure} %[H] %\usepackage{float}
 \begin{center}
  \epsfig{figure=figures/unitdist.eps,width=\textwidth}
  \caption{Consumption unit distribution}
  \label{fig:ConsumptionUnit} \index{consumption unit distribution}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Even this 2021 unit density data after all corrections during years looks good
now on 2023 and seems that nearly all has got more than daily basic social
assistance $18.5\euro/d$\allowbreak\cite{KELA_BASIC_ASSISTANCE} except students
$9.3\euro/d$\allowbreak\cite{KELA_StudyGrant}; I again recall full working
automation for basic
income\allowbreak\cite{BasicIncomeInit}\allowbreak\cite{A2PalkkaerotIlta}
because uncertainty is the worst thing for people having scare resources.

\section{Cost neutral fitting}
\label{cost_neutral_fitting}\index{tax function cost neutral}
When doing changes to taxation, like taking daily support allowance in use,
has taxation also adjusted to cope with new operating situation equation
\ref{eq:cost_comp}. That should be done using up-to-date history information
from statistics and predictions from future including expected dynamic change.
Here we do not know enough well even our domestic income distribution to
calculate accurate fitting and compensation. For demo purposes new base number
value is estimated doing simple demo fitting taking into account social support
so that net effect is zero. One usable possibility is to use known median
income from last year as limit where given benefit and increased taxation is in
balance. Other simpler possibility is set the balance to point where exponent
is one at equation \ref{eq:cost_comp_base} and then needed math simplifies a
bit.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cost_comp} \index{compensation}
t_d(a,b_2,(i_d+i_s))(i_d+i_s) \geq s_d(a)+t_d(a,b_1,i_d)(i_d)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cost_comp_1}
(i_d+i_s)m b_2^{-\frac{cr}{i_d+i_s}}\geq i_s+(i_d) m b_1^{-\frac{cr}{i_d}}
~~;~ b_{1,2} > 1.0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cost_comp_2}
b_2^{-\frac{cr}{i_d+i_s}}\geq
\frac{i_s+(i_d)m b_1^{-\frac{cr}{i_d}}}{(i_d+i_s)m}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cost_comp_base}
b_2\leq\left(\frac{i_s+(i_d)m b_1^{-\frac{cr}{i_d}}}
{(i_d+i_s)m}\right)^{-\frac{i_d+i_s}{cr}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cost_comp_base_cridis}
b_2\leq\frac{crm}{i_s+(cr-i_s)m b_1^{-\frac{cr}{cr-i_s}}}~~;~i_d+i_s=cr
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cost_comp_base_crid}
b_2\leq\left(\frac{b_1(i_s+cr)m}{b_1i_s+crm}\right)^\frac{cr+i_s}{cr}~~;~i_d=cr
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cost_comp_is_b2_1}
i_s\leq\frac{(b_1-1)crm}{(1-m)b_1}~~;~i_d=cr,\,b_2=1
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:B2b1cris} on page \pageref{fig:B2b1cris} shows how from
existing used taxation situation is changed to other compensated operation
point when taking taxed daily social support in use. New base number $b$ is
selected based to new daily support amount and decision where the balance point
is set. To set balance over whole national income distribution requires some
accurate knowledge from income distribution statistics, that is why some
balance point is here selected for demonstration purposes.

Figure \ref{fig:BaseComp} on page \pageref{fig:BaseComp} presents original tax
and for new taxed social support balancing purposes elevated tax curve and
marginal taxes for both situations. This balancing is done at point $c$ which
should be defined based to whole population so that there are no
overcompensation leading to unnecessary tax increase. Existing tax system leads
to jumpy marginal tax, which should be avoided if possible, see
Viitam\"aki\allowbreak\cite{VM_46_2019} p.47 Figure 15, from similar fitting.

Figure \ref{fig:SocTax} on page \pageref{fig:SocTax} show how nominal $20\euro$
daily social support with zero income leaves about $15\euro$ net support income
to account. It represents negative $-15\euro$ tax at that same operation point.
When you follow net support effect comparing to old curve then you notice that
soon when income grows support turns to negative even in new situation official
net support is still positive. Take time to look this picture which brings
together several terms in one picture. Terms like support, negative tax,
positive tax, where those are on figure. You could compare to ministry of
finance publication (Viitam\"aki\allowbreak\cite{VM_46_2019} p.17 equation 1, 2
p.18 Figure 1). In today's computerized society it's just view and
representation change when talking from support, citizen salary or negative
tax. Anyhow, math methods and balance has to be there. With highly automated
model implementation we get better life control for citizens and release few
officials to do more productive work with humans, because computers can do this
work much better and we have enough financial challenges already. You do not
need any paid official there to do decisions do you need money for daily groats
to eat or not in case of sudden personal bankruptcy.

allowance. Besides these basic allowance's citizen may have voluntary
insurances paid separately over these basic social support allowances which
will guarantee some support, no matter which is financial situation. For
example if under \char"2153~income distraint persons wage is already used,
still every day paid support guarantees few euros on account every day.

To avoid from double effective marginal tax rate from housing benefit and from
children daycare payment (Viitam\"aki\allowbreak\cite{VM_46_2019} p.25 equation
2, p.54 Figure 22) we have to include housing benefit, child's part of it, into
support of child's childhood years. Housing benefit, what families get from
child, can be included into model by lifting child benefit years support levels
up. Then bigger families bigger space need support come with the kids.
Apparently merging housing benefit to child benefit here increase automation
and reduce young families stress. Anyhow, birth rate in industrialized
countries like European Union is low and soon firstborn parents are reaching
infertility age, at 2019 EU average 29.4 years for first child and rising,
there might not be any siblings coming therefore, and any failures on child
early life affect to child and economy during whole lifetime, and therefore
it's reasonable to support young families to avoid possible problems at first
phase. And that's reason why supported child daycare basic payment has to be
added to child's own support. It also makes parents free to grow they own
incomes by doing work, because parents income increase do not drop child's
income (A-Talk\allowbreak\cite{ATalk230413213839}, NCP
questions\allowbreak\cite{NCPquestions}). This flat support is shown on figure
\ref{fig:EvenSu} on page
\pageref{fig:EvenSu}.

It's good to note that all these charts should be done as relative to whole
nation statistics (Social Security Committee \cite{VN_2023_26} p.39 figure 6)
so that dependency from currency can be removed. Then relative numbers better
describe economy flows in time independent manner than some currency money
values which are kind local snapshots from day situation, and soon outdated due
inflation, price changes. All money values here are more or less guesses. This
insufficiency is due limited visibility to current situation without existing
compensation information embedded into statistics. Some idea you might get from
these reference values; study grant $9.3\euro/d$ \cite{KELA_StudyGrant}, social
assitance basic amount $18.5\euro/d$ \cite{KELA_BASIC_ASSISTANCE}, adult
education allowance $22\euro/d$ \cite{AdultEducationAllowance}, national
pension $24\euro/d$ \cite{KELA_NATIONAL_PENSION}, guarantee pension $31\euro/d$
\cite{GUARANTEE_PENSION}, minimum wage $42\euro/d$ \cite{KELA_WORK_REQ}, a
decent life in province $38\euro/d$, in a university town $42\euro/d$, in the
capitol $50\euro/d$, in the capital region $52\euro/d$ \cite{THL_2023_1}. The
Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) President Jarkko Eloranta
propose minimum wage $13\euro/h$ at HS interview\allowbreak\cite{
 HS_202307290200_RS}. That is about $63\euro/d$ when divided to all 365 days in
year. Current estimation is that lowest income tenciles will get even less in
future. Government Prime Minister commented \cite{CutExplanation} estimations
from different citizens income tenciles behaviour after govenment program has
been implemented. Government proposal 73/2023\allowbreak\cite{HE_73/2023_vp}
part time job $31\euro/d$ and for full time job $37.8\euro/d$ is minimum,
starting from 2024/9/2. The old system replacing General Social Security
Benefit\allowbreak\cite{GSSB} $26.7\euro/d$, with possible lack of activity
reductions, is scheduled to 2026/05/01, or later during 2026.

\section{Empathy test}
\label{Empathy_test}
\index{arrogance}
\index{empathy test}
If someone has arrogance\allowbreak\cite{OwnFault}, attitude problems against
basic support delivery automation; I suggest that spouse could arrange special
"Empathy-Exercise-Test" for conclusions, and silently drop all e-invoice
agreements before holiday, then looking partner's behavior when first for
thirdparty sold invoice claims arrive about on due day with elevated price,
missing, poor or obfuscated references to original bills, and that all having
only purpose to get most out from the case. Even having enough money to easily
close all cases without checking that all claims are correct without duplicates
or unnecessary payments included, it's still shitload of extra work, you didn't
needed nor wanted. Then is good time to ask the test question; How do you think
someone will survive if they only have money for original bills? If answer is
pure nonwritable from own-personal-situation, then there isn't enough empathy,
and it's time for conlusions, but at least "Test"-person may be able to catch
some feelings what peoples really feel when needing basic
support\allowbreak\cite{HS202412141445} and have this kind of situation after
each hiccup in system\allowbreak\cite{KelaSystemUpdates}\allowbreak\cite{
 Tukimuutokset_2025}\allowbreak\cite{KVV_2025_4}. Currently there are peoples
involved, which means that "It kind of works."\allowbreak\cite{
 KelaProcessUpdates}, but not on time\allowbreak\cite{KELAProcessingTime} as it
should, which seriously increase cost and causes. Therefore FULL AUTOMATION for
peoples BASIC ASSISTANCE daily delivery is needed! No matter do you call it:
Basic Account\allowbreak\cite{LiberaPerustili}, Basic Income, Citizen Wage,
Freedom Dividend, General social security benefit\allowbreak\cite{GSSB},
Negative Tax\allowbreak\cite{BasicIncomeInit}, Universal Basic Income
(UBI)\allowbreak\cite{UniversalBasicIncome} Universal Credit\allowbreak\cite{
 UniversalCredit}, or what ever, it has to work on time as a klock! If it
doesn't, then overall monetary and social cost rise for individuals and for
whole society. And this is not pure technical problem\allowbreak\cite{
 Kelapotti}, it's more a legal mess.

\subsection{Empathy test -- By the way}
\label{Empathy_test_by_the_way}
\index{empathy test}\index{arrogance}\index{selfiness}\index{above oneself}
When we are going into details of possible found arrogant, above oneself
person, self intended "boss"/"leader"- case we really notice that it's not
under powered citizens fault that he/she got problems. No. Actually it's
mostly this arrogant persons fault\allowbreak\cite{OwnFault}. How/Why?

We can take practical example case; people without email and cellular
phone\allowbreak\cite{HS202412141445} want to order service and want electric
billing to avoid paper bill taken higher cost. Purchase agreement is done face
by face with at the vendors office, but by the poor system design or slowness,
vendor customer service sales person do not able to give or print customer
billing information because they SAP implementation can't allocate reference
number on sales situation, or configure pre-allocated number, or use some known
or agreed reference given directly for customer.

If vendor can't give or name billing reference at the sales situation it's not
customers fault. Customer has right to get correct payment information and
vendor has to deliver it freely afterwards and not to demand to take more
expensive paper billing. Information including the reference needed at bank to
automatically pay correct bills.

Without correct billing information bill comes, but it's already sold for
thirdparty, which obviously obfuscated it, meaning that they have let the
original billing reference out, from they documentation and added $25\EUR$ to
price. So, here is no delivery for information how to pay e-bill, and automated
squeezing with elevated price bills has been started. This can be the start of
personal bankruptcy for someone, unless he/she goes to same dealer claims
billing reference or shuts down service if possible, it might be fixed length
agreement. This is untolerable situation especially in country where personal
bankruptcy \cite{PersonalBankruptcy} is not possible. And it's not just
electric company's or telco's who do this, same happens with the all
institutional players, like VarHa had sold out \cite{YLE202510211559}
enforseable bills \cite{YLE202510181426}\allowbreak\cite{YLE202510270829} as
example.

As summary: It is this arrocant, above oneself, persons fault, and he/she/them
doesn't even understand \cite{YLE202510231655} nor willing to understand
\cite{YLE202510271827}\allowbreak\cite{YLE202510282036} that they customer
service and sales processess sucks badly \cite{OwnFault} for customer
\cite{HS202412141445}. Maybe he/she may even understand the situation but
really do not care from situation, because from company perspective customer is
hooked and payments run, due immediately from first bill for third party sold
bills.
%Person\allowbreak\cite{OwnFault} who is so bysy to change hes/her 1.5 year old
%car to newer and bigger as status from hes/her capability used to legitimate
%hes/her own personall billing growth towards the company/institution/society.

\subsection{Empathy test -- No understanding
 nor empathy, law update and enforcement needed}
\label{Empathy_test_fail_law_needed}
\index{empathy test fail}\index{arrogance}
\index{selfiness}\index{above oneself}

We have poor customer process automations in several companies, without any aim
to fix this situatuation, which means that Electronic Invoicing
directive\allowbreak\cite{EULEX_2014_55} and it's local law
imp\-le\-men\-ta\-tion\allowbreak\cite{LEX_2019_241} from government and
corporate operator rights to get electronic billing for purchases has to be
extended with oblications towards same organizations operation towards private
individual customers. Private individual users has to have right to get
electronic billing reference during agreement creation, so that he/she can go
to bank enable e-invoice payments for company before first e-bill comes. Other
option could be generating, immediately when they have needed information
available, freely delivered paper note or "zero-bill" holding needed
information for e-invoising setup on bank or delivery initial bill freely with
the paper and then rest bills through e-invoice system. This has to be added as
legal oblication to serve they own individual customers better, in practice as
addition or amendmend to Electric Invoising Directive\allowbreak\cite{
 EULEX_2014_55}. Same amendmend has to include statement from for forward sold
bills refinancing companies obligation to maintain all previous payment
information including original e-billing references and reference chains
visible in they billing, and besides paper bill mandatory electric copy send to
Suomi-messages \cite{VM006_00_2024} as proof of message sending to avoid
purposeful due date delivery, which may also enforced with the mandatory paper
copy print and send service for peoples not taken electric service in use -- to
make sure that purpoceful due date delivery with own bearer is eliminated. This
limits refinance scavengers
group%\allowbreak\cite{CustomerCreditGrantingAndCollecting}
to get unearned increment into they incomes and this way foster too big
counterproductive players group growth into our society, due into current
digital time incomplete law making. With well working system there is not much
need for refinance, corporations should do they part and national enforcement
authority \cite{NationalEnforcementAuthorityFinland} do rest of task.
